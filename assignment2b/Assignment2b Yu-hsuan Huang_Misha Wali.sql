/*
=============== Start from here ===============
*/
# 1. Use ONLY an OUTER JOIN to display the order number and order date for those orders that have exactly two different parts on the order. Sort the result in descending order number. For example, order number 21617 has two parts BV06 and CD52 on order.
SELECT OD.order_number `order number`, OD.order_date `order date`
FROM tbl_orders OD LEFT OUTER JOIN tbl_order_line OL
ON OD.order_number = OL.order_number
GROUP BY OD.order_number
HAVING count(OD.order_number) = 2
ORDER BY OD.order_number DESC;

# 2. Use ONLY an OUTER JOIN to list the order number, part number, part description, price, quoted price and the price discount(= price â€“ quoted_price) for those parts that are on order and the price discount > 0. Order the result by part number. For example, part number AT94 with order number 21608 was given a discount of 3 dollars.
SELECT OL.order_number `order number`, OL.part_number `part number`, PT.part_description `part description`, PT.price `price`, OL.quoted_price `quoted price`, (PT.price - OL.quoted_price) `price discount` 
FROM tbl_order_line OL LEFT OUTER JOIN tbl_part PT
ON OL.part_number = PT.part_number
WHERE (PT.price - OL.quoted_price) > 0
ORDER BY OL.part_number;

# 3. Use ONLY an INNER JOIN to list the rep number and full address (concatenate the street, city, state and zip each separated by a comma) of the rep, with the name of the customer he/she represents, if the rep number's street contains Jackson. YOU NEED TO USE STRING FUNCTION(S) to check if the street contains Jackson and LIKE is not a function fyi. Sort the output by rep number. For example, rep 25 lives on street 124 Jackson.
SELECT REP.rep_number `rep number`, CONCAT(REP.street, ', ', REP.city ,', ', REP.state, ', ' , REP.zip) `full address`, CUS.customer_name `customer name`
FROM tbl_rep REP INNER JOIN tbl_customer CUS
USING(rep_number)
WHERE INSTR(REP.street, 'Jackson') != 0
ORDER BY REP.rep_number;

# 4. Use ONLY an INNER JOIN to display the customer number and his/her order total, only for all his/her orders, if the order total >= 1000. Sort the output by customer number. The total of any order is (quantity_ordered* quoted_price). For example, the order total for customer 408, who has two orders, is 4*329.95 + 1*399.99 = 1719.79
SELECT OD.customer_number `customer number`, SUM(OL.number_ordered * OL.quoted_price) `order total`
FROM tbl_orders OD INNER JOIN tbl_order_line OL
USING (order_number)
GROUP BY (OD.customer_number)
HAVING SUM(OL.number_ordered * OL.quoted_price) >= 1000
ORDER BY OD.customer_number;

# 5. Use ONLY a JOIN to display the rep number and full name (concatenate the first and last name, separated by a blank) of the rep(s) who does not represent any customer currently. For example, rep number 99 (Anju Chawla) does not represent any customer.
SELECT REP.rep_number `rep number`, CONCAT_WS(' ', REP.first_name, REP.last_name) `full name`
FROM tbl_rep REP LEFT OUTER JOIN tbl_customer CUS
USING (rep_number)
WHERE CUS.customer_number IS NULL;

# 6. Using a CORRELATED SUBQUERY ONLY (with exists/not exists), find the rep number and rep name (first name and last name concatenated) of each rep who represents a customer living in the zip 33321. Order the result by rep number. For example, rep number 25, Greg Smith has a customer living in that zip.
SELECT rep_number `rep number`, CONCAT(first_name, last_name) `full name`
FROM tbl_rep
WHERE rep_number IN (SELECT rep_number FROM tbl_customer WHERE zip = '33321')
ORDER BY rep_number;

# 7. Using a CORRELATED SUBQUERY ONLY (with exists/not exists), find the customer number and name of each customer whose rep does not live in city Grove. Order the result by customer number. For example, the rep of customer number 282 (Brookings Direct) does not live in Grove city.
SELECT customer_number `customer number`, customer_name `customer name`
FROM tbl_customer
WHERE rep_number IN (SELECT rep_number FROM tbl_rep WHERE city NOT IN ('Grove'))
ORDER BY customer_number;

# 8. Use ONLY a subquery to find the number and name of each customer that currently has an order on file for a Washer (description of the part). No other information is available so code the solution only based on information given. For example, customer number 356 (Ferguson's) has an order for Washer.
SELECT CUS.customer_number `customer number`, CUS.customer_name `customer name`
FROM tbl_customer CUS, tbl_orders OD, tbl_order_line OL
WHERE OL.part_number = (SELECT part_number FROM tbl_part WHERE part_description = 'Washer')
	AND OL.order_number = OD.order_number 
    AND OD.customer_number = CUS.customer_number;

# 9. Use ONLY a subquery and the ANY(not ALL) keyword (NO INBUILT FUNCTION ALLOWED) to list the part number, part description, unit price and class for each part that has a unit price greater than the unit price of every part in the Appliances class, AP. Order the results by part number. For example, price of part number BV06 (Home Gym) is greater than the price of all parts in the AP class.
SELECT part_number `part number`, part_description `part description`, price, class
FROM tbl_part
WHERE price > ANY (SELECT price FROM tbl_part WHERE class = 'AP')
	AND class != 'AP';
